## Online Payment Fraud Detection Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent online payments. Detecting fraud in online transactions is crucial to ensure the security and trustworthiness of e-commerce platforms, financial institutions, and customers. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on relevant features such as transaction details, user behavior, and historical data.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop robust classification models that accurately detect fraudulent online payments. These models will assist financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in identifying and preventing fraud, thereby enhancing security and reducing financial losses.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as transaction amount, transaction date, user behavior metrics, and historical transaction patterns. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project are:
- Decision Tree Classifier

### Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
